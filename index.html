          <h5 class="card-title">CAREER</h5>
          <p class="card-text">I have worked as a Chef & at a large supplier of Fruit & Veg to the catering industry. I havent had many jobs as I tend to be a stayer only moving for new experience or because an opportunity arose I would have been foolish to miss. My moving to My current job was definitely one of those moves.</p>
         <P>I currently work at Amdec Industrial Products as their Operations Manager, we supply all Materials Handling Equipment.</P>
        <P>I have worked at Amdec for 20 years & I have been a big part of the companies Development & Growth. Working in all areas of the company & have been the key player in the setting up of each department within the company.</P>
      <P>So this brings me to Coding.  We have developed our Service & Production side & We now have our show rooms ready & open to the public, but our Internet & Web site are not developed, so I was given the task to now develope this side of the Company. we need to be part of the 20th Century & move us properly onto the Web this is where alot of future sales lies.</P>

          <h5 class="card-title">MY LIFE</h5>
          <p class="card-text">I am the proud Mother of 3 Daughters & I have 4 Grandchildren, HaHa & 3 Granddogs they are definitely a big part of our family.</p>
        <p>    I am a Gym member & convinced 30 of my fellow friends there to do an activity with me, not sure they forgave me, but it was to do Tough Guy Nettle Warrior a 17k army assault course it was painful.</p>
<p>My favourite pass time is to take advantage of the fact I live in the countryside & take long walks with my family or friends,
    My Grandchildren have Dogs so we love to walk as a family with the dogs, in non Covid times calling at a Garden Centre or Pub to have Sunday lunch together.</p>
  <p>I really enjoy cooking for Family & Friends is also a passion of mine. Cooking with my Grandchildren is the best. My eldest 2 Grandsons are becoming very good Chefs themselves, the thing is if you let children be apart of preparing their meals its amazing how much more the will try new food because they have put the effort in they want to taste the good.</p>
