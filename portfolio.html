        This was the Decade of the Beatles, Rock & roll, Elvis Presley, people
        just wanted to dance & go to the Flicks. A time for Hippies & free love,
        Twiggy & skinny models, hour glass figures on the way out, people became
        more into following various Fashions of the time including Drugs, Sex &
        Rock & Roll. Class structure started to breakdown & women gained more
        control of their own lives.

        something we hope we would never see again happend THE FAULKLANDS WAR,
        fleets of our Navy war ships sailing out from our shores to the other
        side of the world, carrying our airforce, our soldiers. We are showing
        the world our force & finding ourselves with an enemy we didnt know we
        had for an island that was more their neighbour than ours.
