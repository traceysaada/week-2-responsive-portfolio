        This was the Decade of the Beatles, Rock & roll, Elvis Presley, people
        just wanted to dance & go to the Flicks. A time for Hippies & free love,
        Twiggy & skinny models, hour glass figures on the way out, people became
        more into following various Fashions of the time including Drugs, Sex &
        Rock & Roll. Class structure started to breakdown & women gained more
        control of their own lives.

        something we hope we would never see again happend THE FAULKLANDS WAR,
        fleets of our Navy war ships sailing out from our shores to the other
        side of the world, carrying our airforce, our soldiers. We are showing
        the world our force & finding ourselves with an enemy we didnt know we
        had for an island that was more their neighbour than ours.

        As the mother of 3 girls & having been brought up with the gender sterio-typing, 
        I decided the best way to show my Daughters how to develop as free indepentend women was to lead by example. 
        I thought the best way was to let them see that being a female in todays world literally means you can have it all if you want it. 
        So I started by doing various courses that I could find, eventually going to college & doing computer studies (scary as I had never used a computer before), 
        basic front end typing, excel, rsa, book keeping a start to getting in the world of employment after having time out having the children. the govenment had started college course refered to as return to work, so this is where I started.

        the owner put a lot of trust in me. help organise & set up different departments, learned new computer programmes & taught others how to use them, 
        please see my CV for all the information on my job development with this company. Also started to travel more & explore other parts of the world. got to visit Algeria, facinating country, had some nice holidays travelled on my own but was quite an adventure. 
        I have always been lucky in that I meet lovely interesting people so I never really feel alone.
        Joined the gym, made lots of lovely new friends, we did some great challenges together. 
        One that I organised was to do Tough Guy Nettle Warrior a 17k Army Assault course got 27 of my gym friends to do this with me & raised money for charity.

          <strong></p> <p class="card-text">Now the Operations Manager</strong><p>
    
    loved this decade Watch my Girls develop into beautiful young ladies, 
    carving out their own careers & dreams, marriages. I became a Grandma. 
    so it worked my leading by example, my daughters are beautiful mothers, 
    successfull career women & the most important thing of all they are happy. which means I am also happy.
    watch my own career grow, I look after the bigger accounts at Amdec & do the buying & selling of all parts & some of the other products, I have continued with the development along side Alistair the owner of the company I work for. 
    The Company is now one of the biggest independent Forklift Companies. 
    later in the decade we was made a Partner with the large international Company Jungheinrich & we continue to grow.
    We have moved premises & are now going to develop anotherside to the company which I have been put in charge off. 
    So the next decade is the move onto the internet.

        <strong></p> <p class="card-text">The world has changed, World Pandemic "Cornonvirus"</strong><p>
    Companies are now learning social distancing, more sales are being made via the internet, 
    the pandemic will change the way people buy, sell & do business.
    So my new challenge is to take the company I work on to the web. 
    So I looked up coding & web development & here I am currently doing Full Stack Web Development at Manchester University. 
    wow It is hard, it is challenging, but it is also very interesting, who knew all this went on in the back ground of our computers.
    we click a button not realising the work & the programming that goes into making the internet work. 
    It is the hardest thing I have ever had to learn but one of the most interesting, 
    to create code & see it come to life is like magic & I feel like I know the magicians secret. 
    love the team work that goes into coding, all the complexities of coding does require a team if you are to achieve the best, 
    but also the feeling of achievement when you manage your own piece of coding & it works, 
    there is no feeling like it. 
    very interested to see where my next decade takes me as it has started off with such a challenging new beginning.
