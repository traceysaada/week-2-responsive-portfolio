**********************
new work on portfolio: got links working & added new tab page for project & homework links to display work.

going to add some new card blocks to house the links.

added a CV tab as I wanted this also to be on my portfolio. the tab is great, love the iframe part for showing & scrolling of my CV but need to do more work on this as it doesnt load my CV on the live server.

I have added cards & styling to the projects page. this helps to make each homework section & projects stand out.

the whole portfolio is now set to add further information in the future.

I want the user to be abe to do the following.

when clicking on browser initial look is to see my about me home page.
then the user can click the portfolio tab & find out a little bit of what happened in each decade of my life & have a fun insite to me.

the user can then click on the contact tab for ability to contact me.

& finally click on my CV for a more indepth information of my working life.

********************
INITIAL README

initial set up of my html pages & the adding of the navbar

next stage was to think about my headers & what I wanted each page to show about me.

the contact page is self explanatory & is my contact details & although I dont know how to link them yet I have added the link status for updating at a later date.

home page is about the browser learnng more about me, so \I added a picture & some basic carrer information & personal information about me.

portfolio loving adding cards to the portfolio it is only 3 decades as yet but hoping to add more as I go along & can add some more intering layouts & fun facts about events so far in different decades of my life.

had so much fun designing & playing with various aspects of bootstrap, javascript & just seeing how far I could push myself. 

getting access to various web sites & doing searches has played a major role in the planing of the portfolio.

it is still a work in progress. learning curb has been immense & confidence in commiting & push comands now achieved.

# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 


## Directions

First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

* Create the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

* Screenshots are provided as a reference in the `Assets/Images` folder. Your app does not need to be _exactly_ like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.

### Hints

* Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.

* Use an HTML validation service to ensure that each page has valid HTML.

### Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work.

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.

### Bonus

* Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (**Hint:** Check out the Bootstrap documentation).

## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

* Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

* Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

Follow these guidelines for committing:

* Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

* Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

* Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

* Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!

## Submission on BCS

You are required to submit the following:

* The URLs of the deployed applications

* The URLs of the GitHub repositories
